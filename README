For exercise #2, you'll be writing an IRC bot!  But not just any IRC bot, one
that integrates with a web service to give you a chat based interface to some
neat app out there.  This will give you a chance to practice web service
integration while simultaneously producing some neat toys for us to play with
in our IRC channel.

This exercise is pretty open ended, but please follow the guidelines listed below.

== GUIDELINES

1. You can use any Ruby based IRC framework you'd like to write your bot.  I
would recommend looking at cinch or isaac, but if you know of another library
you want to use, go for it.

2. You must integrate with some external application, preferably one that you
haven't interacted with programatically before.

3. Any service that we all can access via HTTP without charge is fair game.  
Even if you want to do something like use Mechanize to scrape a site that 
has no defined service API, that'd be acceptable.

4. Your bot needs to connect to #rmu-session-0 and have the word bot in its
nickname.  

5. All interaction with your bot should be done by simply reading the messages
posted to #rmu-session-0 and responding to certain messages that form your
interface.

6. You should use the mailing list to communicate what sorts of bots you are
building, and what sorts of commands they will respond to, so as to avoid
clashes with other student's bots.  Ideally, no two bots will respond to the
same command, or provide the same featureset.

7. You may test your bot in #rmu-session-0 whenever there is not active
conversation going on.  You're encouraged to do so in fact, just because it'll
be fun to see things as they come together.

8. You may look at other bots for inspiration, but do not submit a solution that
simply mirrors something else you found.  Be creative :)

== EXAMPLE

A weather bot:

<sandal>: !weather 06770
<examplebot>: It's super sunny and hot, buddy! 

A search bot:

<sandal> !google Cats
<examplebot>: http://icanhascheezburger.com | http://kittens.com | ...

But since both of these have been done so many times before, please pick
something else.

== QUESTIONS?

Hit up the mailing list or IRC.
